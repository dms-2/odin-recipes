        <p>Julie is a renowned salad maker, and the beauty generally lives in its simplicity. A visit to San Francisco isn't complete without
            a salad prepped by Julie.</p>
        <p>The problem, though, is there's no recipe for a Julie salad. This is an attempt to capture one that makes me think of eating dinner by the Ebert's pool.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A bag of arugula</li>
            <li>Half a watermelon, cubed</li>
            <li>A block of feta cheese, crumbled</li>
            <li>Dill sprigs</li>
            <li>Olive oil to taste</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Fresh pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix arugula, watermelon, feta, and dill in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the amount of olive oil you like in a salad, generally a tablespoon or two should do.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        </ol>
