    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dish is a favorite of Nick's and was one of the first recipes he thought of as "his own." It's quick to put together and a delicious weekday meal.</p>
    <p>My main recommendation is that the water in the recipe as shown on the website can be reduced for a more al dente pasta.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces smoked andouille sausage</li>
        <li>1/2 medium fennel bulb</li>
        <li>4 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 (14.5-ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>12 ounces dried linguine pasta</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh basil leaves, plus more for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Cut 12 ounces andouille sausage crosswise into 1/2-inch thick rounds and thinly slice 1/2 medium fennel bulb. 
        Place both in a large, straight-sided skillet. Add 4 1/2 cups water, 1 can fire-roasted diced tomatoes and their juices,
         12 ounces dried linguine, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.</li> 
       <li>Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil the mixture, stirring and turning the pasta with tongs to prevent sticking, 
        until the pasta is al dente and almost all the liquid has evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, tear 1 cup fresh basil 
        leaves in half. In the last 2 minutes of cooking, add the basil.</li>
       <li>Remove from the heat. Taste and season with more salt as needed. Garnish with more fresh basil.</li>
    </ol>
